# Frontend Challenge

In the attachment you will find a folder with country flags. Data for the countries is retrieved from this API: <https://retoolapi.dev/TkEl3I/countriesdata>

Your task is to develop a language switch that is based on the design of the template.

Please use either a React Context, Redux or Zustand.

The component should work in such a way that the countries are sorted by region and when you click on a country, the country code of this country is loaded into the store.

In addition, please create a simple navigation bar where the current country with the corresponding flag should be displayed on the right.

Clicking on this component should open the language picker and you should be able to select a different country.
